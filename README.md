First of all, make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

You will also need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to start the container in order to make the project work.

# :rocket:Launch the project:rocket:

To launch the project, first you need to clone the project repository on [git](https://github.com/CeruleanDawnstar/shortnerBack.git)

Then you use `docker-compose up` to create the container.


# :memo:Sidenote:memo:

If you need to restart the container you can use :

> `docker-compose down`

And restart the server back up :

> `docker-compose up --build`

You can use the navbar to navigate to the different options available like login, signup, listUrl or just put the following links to test them out :
- http://localhost:8125/login to test the login
- http://localhost:8125/signUp to test the signup
- http://localhost:8125/links to list all the links stored in database
- http://localhost:8125/link/1 to get the link whose ID is 1
